# Miz Jam 1 - Neon Desert
Welcome to my game entry for Miziziziz's Game Jam! This project is a 48-hour implementation of my game **Neon Desert** using the Godot Engine.

## About the Game
**Neon Desert** is an isometric shooter arcade game inspired by the vibrant aesthetics of the '80s, featuring neon lights and a retro vibe.

## Gameplay
In each stage, players navigate through the desert from an isometric perspective, with the primary goal of defeating every enemy encountered.

## Development
This is my first Game Jam, and I developed this game solo in just 48 hours for Miz Jam 1. The game utilizes the Jam Art Kit, specifically the 1-Bit Pack by Kenney. It was created using the Godot Engine 3.2.1.

## Controls
